          <p>
           Starting with version 1.4 the H2DB database enforces that the
           path specified for the database files must be absolute
           (starting with "./", "/", or "~/").  The book examples were
           written using 1.3 versions of H2DB which did not enforce this.
           The fix is to edit the db definition xml files and R
           connection commands to make sure
           you have absolute paths. Use:
           <code>jdbc:h2:./H2DB;...</code>
           and not: <code>jdbc:h2:H2DB;...</code>.

          <h2>Pages 25 through 29 section 2.2.1 A production-sized example</h2>
          <p>
            We no longer recommend using H2DB, Java, and SquirreL SQL to load data.  Instead we recommend using R, read.table, and dbWriteTable using either PostgreSQL (for a lot of data) or RSQlite (for in-memory practice).  Nina has a write-up of the replacement screwdriver concept <a href="http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2016/02/using-postgresql-in-r/">here</a>.

          <h2>Pages 125-138, Section 6.3 Building models using many variables</h2>
          <p>We strongly recommend splitting your training set into
two pieces, and using one piece for the construction of single
variable models, and only the other disjoint portion of the training
data for model construction. The issue is any row of data examined
during single variable model construction is no longer exchangeable
with even test data (let alone future data). Models trained on rows
used to build the variable encodings tend to overestimate effect
sizes of the sub-models (or treated variables), underestimate degrees
of freedom, and get significances wrong.  We think the KNN model in
this section happened to perform okay due to the aggressive variable
pruning heuristic in listing 6.11.</p>

            It is a good idea to harden the look-up <code>vTab[pos,]</code> to <code>vTab[as.character(pos),]</code>
            to defend against the irregular nature of <code>R</code>'s indexing operator (which would fail in this
            case if we were to have <code>pos</code> as a logical instead of a string).

          <p>
          The "2 times" in listing 6.11 is because statistical deviance is
          traditionally written as -2*(log(p|model) - log(p|saturatedModel)).
          We are using a "delta deviance" or improvement of deviance given by
          <code>-2*(log(p|model) - log(p|saturatedModel)) - (-2*(log(p|nullModel) -
          log(p|saturatedModel)))</code>.  We wrote this as <code>2*log(p|model)-baseRateCheck</code>
          and it is a deviance style metric (not an AIC style metric as claimed in the text,
          which got behind the code zip file by one revision).
          <p>
          </p>The
          text above listing 6.11 on page 126 claims we are going to use an AIC-like metric.  The original
          implementation did this by subtracting a variable entropy
          estimate from each liCheck in the the catVars list and subtracted 1
          from each numeric variable (a placeholder).  This turned out to not be
          useful for the data set at hand (this is the sort of thing you do want to try variations of), 
          and evidently we removed it without
          completely updating the text.

          <h2>Page 148, Are there systematic errors?</h2>
          <h2>Page 224, Footnote 5</h2>
          <p>
           Our description of "heteroscedasticity" is wrong and
           (unintentionally) conflates a number of different negative issues.
           Our intent was to expand on a simple definition such as "In
           statistics, a collection of random variables is
           heteroscedastic if there are sub-populations that have
           different variabilities from others" (taken
           from <a target="_blank"
           href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroscedasticity">Wikipedia:
           Heteroscedasticity</a>).  Unfortunately we pushed this too
           far (roughly saying "it is bad if errors correlate with y's"
           when we
           meant to say "it was bad if errors correlate with unobserved
           ideal y's which don't already have the error term added in", i.e. with functions of the x's).
           </p>
           <p>The correct thing to do is state that regression
           (and in particular the diagnostics of a regression) depends
           on a number of assumptions about the data.  Important properties
           include (paraphrased from Gelman, Carlin,
           Stern, Dunson, Vehtari, and Rubin "Bayesian
           Data Analysis" 3rd edition pp. 369-376) model
           structure, linearity of expected value of y as a function
           of the x's, bias of error terms, normality of error terms,
           independence of observations, and constancy of variance.
           For more see 
           <a target="_blank" href="http://andrewgelman.com/2013/08/04/19470/">What are the key assumptions of linear regression?</a>.
          </p>
           <p>
           Also, the frequenstist version of regression is commonly said to make no assumptions
           on the distribution of data or parameters (only on distribution of errors).
           This is not quite true as even the frequentist analysis depends on independence
           of observations (which is a fact about x's in addition to y's and errors).
           And a Bayesian treatment may need to assume some form of priors on one
           or more of these to get well behaved detailed posterior estimates.
          </p>
          <p>We will correct later editions of the book, and hope
          our error does not overly distract from the important 
          lesson that you must be aware of modeling assumptions.
          We do note with some amusement how rarely "Bayesian
          Data Analysis" 3rd edition pp. 369-376 uses the
          term "heteroscedasticity" even though these are
          the pages tagged with this term in the index (these authors
          rightly emphasizing concepts over naming).

          <p>Normality of errors is desirable, but not necessary for linear regression (see

             and <a target="_blank" href="http://andrewgelman.com/2013/08/04/19470/">What are the key assumptions of linear regression?</a>). We had previously said the errors must be normally distributed (and we certainly did not mean to imply the <code>y</code> or <code>x</code> need to be normally distributed).</p>
          <p>Replace "<bold>INTERPRETING MODEL SIGNIFICANCES</bold>" with:</p>
          <p>
           <p> <bold>INTERPRETING MODEL SIGNIFICANCES</bold> </p>
Many of the tests of linear regression, including the tests for coefficient and model significance, are sensitive to model assumptions.  It's important to examine graphically or using quantile analysis to determine if the regression model is behaving as expected.</p>
