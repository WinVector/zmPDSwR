set.seed(235236) 	# Note: 1 
d <- data.frame(EarnedIncome=100000*rlnorm(100),
                 CapitalGains=100000*rlnorm(100))  	# Note: 2

# [1] -0.01066116 	# Note: 3 

# Note 1: 
#   Set the pseudo-random seed to a known 
#   value so the demonstration is repeatable. 

# Note 2: 
#   Generate our synthetic data 

# Note 3: 
#   The correlation is -0.01, which is very 
#   near zero. Indicating (as designed) no relation.
