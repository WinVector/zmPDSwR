# Note 1: 
#   Username to use for database 
#   connection. 

# Note 2: 
#   Password to use for database 
#   connection. 

# Note 3: 
#   Java classname of the database driver. SQL 
#   Screwdriver used JDBC, which is a broad database 
#   application programming interface layer. You could 
#   use another database such as PostgreSQL by 
#   specifying a different driver name, such as 
#   org.postgresql.Driver. 

# Note 4: 
#   URL specifying database. For H2, it’s just 
#   jdbc:h2: followed by the file prefix you wish to 
#   use to store data. The items after the semicolon 
#   are performance options. For PostgreSQL, it would 
#   be something more like 
#   jdbc:postgresql://host:5432/db. The descriptions 
#   of the URL format and drivers should be part of 
#   your database documentation, and you can use 
#   SQuirreL SQL to confirm you have them 
#   right.
