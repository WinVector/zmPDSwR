 * start with README.Rmd and Workbook1.xlsx
 * produce README.md, HotelRelation.pdf and figure/* by running "knit('README.Rmd')" in R
 * produce README.html by running "pandoc README.md -o README.html" in bash shell
 * or all in one shot at the bash shell: echo "library('knitr'); knit('README.Rmd')" | R --vanilla ; pandoc README.md -o README.html
